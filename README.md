# Neural Network from scratch


To get a better understanding of Neural Networks I programmed this Neural Network form scratch (just using NumPy) with an implemented backpropagation and a gradient-descent function.

After a short testing the Neuronal Network prediction and learning seems to work perfectly fine. Since it was build only for learning purposes from here on I did use TensorFlow for further Neural Networks.
