# Neuronal Network from scratch


To get a better understanding of Neuronal Networks I programmed this Neuronal Network form scratch (just using NumPy) with an implemented backporpagation and a gradient-descent function.

After a short testing the Neuronal Network prediction and learning seems to works perfectly fine. Since it was build only for learning purpose from here on I did use TensorFlow for further Neuronal Networks.
